# The 500 determines the maximum distance between the closest pairs of fiducials, in nm
# The '5' value determines the maximum number of beads to look for, in cells with many beads detection can fail if too few are considered across channels
# The '3' value in colocalization referes to the window size used in colocalization analysis, increase for a wider scope, decrease for a finer view
